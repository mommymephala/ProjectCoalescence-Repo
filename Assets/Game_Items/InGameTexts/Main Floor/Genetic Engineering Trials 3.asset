  - Text: Concerns are mounting. Some of the plant species are exhibiting traits
      that were not part of the original design. This includes a rapid mutation rate
      and a tendency to spread beyond their designated areas. Control measures are
      becoming less effective.

  - Text: A decision has been made to cease further genetic manipulation in this
      chamber. The current state of the ecosystem presents a blend of wonder and
      hazard, a testament to the unpredictability of nature. We will continue to
      monitor and document, but direct intervention is now limited. The balance of
      this engineered environment must be respected.
